# Analyzing the Relationship Between GDP and Life Expectancy

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six nations: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. The data spans from 2000 to 2015 and is sourced from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The analysis utilizes various statistical techniques and visualizations to provide insights into how GDP and life expectancy interact over time and across different countries.

## Goals
- Investigate trends in life expectancy and GDP over time.
- Explore the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
- Provide insights and recommendations for policymakers on how economic growth might influence public health.

## Types of Analysis and Charts Explored
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Line Plots**: Trend analysis over time.
- **Scatter Plots**: Correlation analysis between GDP and life expectancy.
- **Bar Plots**: Comparison of average values.
- **Violin Plots**: Distribution analysis.

### Advanced Statistical Analysis
- **Probability Distribution**: Analyze life expectancy trends and policy implications.
- **Law of Large Numbers**: Compare averages of life expectancy.
- **Conditional Probability**: Correlate GDP with life expectancy.
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Compare distributions of life expectancy.
- **T-tests**: One-sample and two-sample tests to compare life expectancies.
- **Swarm Plots**: Compare distributions of GDP by country.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and convert GDP values for better readability.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze GDP and life expectancy trends for each country.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
4. **Statistical Tests**: Perform various statistical tests to draw conclusions from the data.
